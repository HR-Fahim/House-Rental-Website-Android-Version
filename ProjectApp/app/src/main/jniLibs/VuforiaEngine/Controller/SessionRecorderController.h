 * \{
 * This controller facilitates recording data from data sources such as on-device camera and sensors
 * while running Vuforia.
 *
 * \par Permissions
 *
 * In order to support audio recording capabilities in the Session Recorder Controller, your App must fulfill audio-related,
 * platform-specific permission / configuration requirements. Your App is responsible for executing the following platform-specific actions
 * prior to invoking Session Recorder Controller API functions relying on information whether audio recording is enabled in the app:
 *
 * - Android:
 *     - Add the "android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" permission to the AndroidManifest.xml and also request it at run-time in your App's code.
 *
 * - iOS:
 *     - Microphone usage description: Add the key "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription" to the Info.plist with an explanation why your
 *       App requires microphone access, otherwise the App will be rejected by the App Store submission process.
 *     - Microphone access: Request access to the microphone by calling the "AVCaptureDevice requestAccessForMediaType" API with the
 *       media type "AVMediaTypeAudio".
 *
 * - UWP:
 *     - Add the following snippet to the \b \<Capabilities\> tag in your App's Package.appxmanifest to enable audio recording capabilities:

 *       \code{.xml}
 *         <Capabilities>
 *             <DeviceCapability Name="microphone" />
 *         </Capabilities>
 *       \endcode
 *
 * - Lumin:
 *     - Add the key "AudioCaptureMic" to the manifest.xml to enable audio recording capabilities.
 *
 * If the aforementioned platform-specific permission / configuration requirements are not fulfilled by the App, then
 *     - the vuSessionRecorderControllerGetSupportedRecordingDataFlags call won't report audio support
 *       (i.e. VU_RECORDING_DATA_AUDIO_BIT will be missing)
 *     - the vuSessionRecorderControllerCreateRecording call will fail with VU_RECORDING_START_ERROR_DATA_SOURCE if
 *       VuRecordingConfig.dataFlags is configured to record audio
