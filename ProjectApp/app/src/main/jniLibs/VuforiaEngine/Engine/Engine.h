// ======== FUNDAMENTAL VUFORIA API CONCEPTS ========

/**
 * <!--
 * [API Concepts]

\par General
Vuforia does not promise any ABI compatibility between releases. Developers are expected to recompile the code with the new
headers. We do not support just exchanging the binaries.

\par
Developers are advised to follow best practices documented in our API and sample application code. As an example, developers
should use the struct initializer functions such as vuConfigDefault() to initialize observer configuration
instead of directly initializing these structs through aggregate initialization.

\par Syntax
All types, data structures, functions start with a \b Vu prefix using the following notation:
 - \b vuFunctionName for functions and procedures
 - \b VuType for type (e.g. public typedef, opaque type, enum, struct, etc)
 - \b VU_VALUE for any enum values or define values

\par Type
Most objects in the Vuforia Engine API are represented by pointers (handles) to opaque struct types. The majority of functions
in Vuforia Engine operate on these opaque pointers to objects. The general pattern is thereby that the opaque pointer
is the first parameter for the respective functions related to this type (equivalent to the 'this' pointer in C++).
The function will be prefixed with the respective type. For example a \b vuEngine...() function will always take a opaque
pointer to a VuEngine instance as the first parameter.

\par
The API also contains data structures in the form of structs which are mainly used for providing configuration
or for retrieving properties of the opaque types.

\par
For container data types such as a list, you need to use a dedicated API for creating, destroying, accessing elements,
e.g. for a list containing elements of type "Object" use
 - vuObjectListCreate(ObjectList** list)
 - vuObjectListDestroy(ObjectList* list)
 - vuObjectListGetSize(const ObjectList* list, int32_t* listSize)
 - vuObjectListGetElement(const ObjectList* list, int32_t elementIndex, Object** element)

\par
Please be aware of padding when using a Vuforia structures directly if you want to wrap the API in another language.

\par Functions
All functions use the \b VU_API preprocessor macro for export and \b VU_API_CALL for the calling convention.
Function syntax uses the following convention:

\par
<tt>return_value vuObjectTypeAction(ObjectType* \b , \b [param])</tt> when you want to execute the action on an object of type ObjectType.

\par
Common actions are Create, Destroy, Get, Set, Acquire, Release.

\par
Return value:
 - Most functions return VuResult to indicate execution success / failure
 - Some utility functions (e.g. math) will return a value that allows chaining such calls easily (e.g. mathematical expression)

\par
Parameters:
 - First parameter is usually a handle to an object (exceptions include utility functions)
 - Output parameters are at the end of the parameter list

\par
Please note that the API does not perform any sanity checks to catching passing NULL or invalid values (e.g. already freed memory).

\par
Some of the Get() functions have an associated Has() function that should be used prior to Get() to test whether
there is a valid object instance to retrieve in case the returned object is optional or not yet available. If there is
no valid instance, then the getter function will return VU_FAILED. For examples, see e.g. vuObservationHasPoseInfo() and
vuObservationGetPoseInfo().

\par Ownership
The objects managed by Engine generally have a hierarchical ownership relation. Objects retrieved via Get() functions
are owned by the object they are retrieved from.

\par
For example, in order to get the image data for the current camera frame, you need to first retrieve a VuCameraFrame
from a VuState by calling vuStateGetCameraFrame(), and then retrieve a VuImageList from the VuCameraFrame
via vuCameraFrameGetImages() which provides access the VuImage instances of the frame. The lifetime of the VuImage
instances retrieved via the VuImageList will be bound to the lifetime of the VuCameraFrame instance, which in
turn will be bound to the lifetime of the VuState instance. If the lifetime of the VuState ends, all pointers
to objects directly or indirectly owned by the VuState instance will be invalidated throughout this ownership
hierarchy and should not be accessed after this point.

\par
Similarly, output buffer data retrieved via Get() functions, such as strings (const char*) or general memory buffers
(e.g. void*), will be bound to the lifetime of the object they have been retrieved from.

\par
Note that the ownership relation also extends to string or buffer pointers returned as members of non-opaque structs.
For example, when retrieving information about a VuImage via VuImageInfo, the lifetime of the buffer pointer member of
the VuImageInfo struct is bound to the lifetime of the VuImage instance the VuImageInfo was retrieved from.

\par
In general, const char* string data provided as an input parameter will be copied, meaning the buffer can be freed up
again after the call. For general buffer data provided as input please refer to the documentation of the respective
function on how the data will be handled.

\par
Objects created with \b vuCreate..() are owned by the application and should be explicitly destroyed
with the corresponding \b vuDestroy..() function as soon as they are not needed any more.

\par
For some objects owned by the Engine instance the API provides ways to acquire an explicit reference via \b vuAcquire..()
to keep the data beyond the usual lifetime. These objects need to be explicitly released again via a call to
\b vuRelease..() to free up the resources.

\par
 It is strongly recommended to explicitly destroy/release objects as soon as they are not needed any more
and not to hold on to these longer than required. This is particularly important for data from the state, like e.g.
frame image data, to allow Engine to free up resources internally. If the data is required for an extended amout of time,
the client should instead create a copy of the data needed.

\par
Note that when Vuforia Engine is destroyed it will free up any resources internally and will also invalidate pointers owned
by Engine. It will also invalidate pointers to some object types explicitly created/acquired by the client application,
such as observers and state references, that hold on to important internal resources. In general, the client should not access
any pointers to objects after Engine destruction and should explicitly destroy/release any pointers prior to destroying
the Engine instance in order to avoid any resource leaks.

\par
See also the documentation of the respective API functions for information on ownership and lifetime.

\par Versioning
At compilation time, you can access the <b> VU_VERSION_MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH </b> preprocessor values defined in the
VuforiaEngine.h umbrella header file. At runtime, you can query the Vuforia Engine version by calling the function
vuEngineGetLibraryVersionInfo().

\par Multi-threading and thread safety
The Vuforia API is NOT thread-safe and API functions should NOT be called concurrently from multiple threads.
It is the responsibility of the client code to ensure that concurrent calls from multiple threads to Vuforia API
functions are synchronized. Failing to protect these API calls from concurrent access in multiple threads might
result in undefined behavior including memory corruption, instability or crashes.

\par Vuforia callbacks
Vuforia Engine callbacks are executed on a dedicated internal thread. Callback implementations in client code need
to be synchronized with other threads in your client code. Note that Vuforia Engine uses several other threads
internally to operate the AR pipeline.

\par
The Vuforia Engine internally synchronizes all API calls made from a client thread with the callback thread.
All API calls are performed in a blocking manner and the internal state is guaranteed to be updated once control
returns to user code. As a consequence, changes to the internal AR pipeline (e.g. observer manipulation via
functions such as vuObserverActivate(), vu*ObserverSetTargetScale(), etc.) may take one camera frame to process
until they return. API calls are executed immediately when Vuforia is not running or called from within the state
handler callback on the camera thread.

\par
Due to the synchronous nature of the Vuforia API internals, it is possible that the Vuforia State obtained via
the registered state handler or via vuEngineAcquireLatestState() may not reflect changes made during the last camera
frame. Observations from an observer deactivated or destroyed during the last frame might still be reported.

\par Callbacks and reentrancy
The Vuforia API allows reentrant calls to be performed during callbacks such as the camera state handler or the
Cloud Image Target observation handler, except calls controlling the Vuforia Engine's lifecycle such as vuEngineStop()
or vuEngineDestroy(), as well as functions modifying the callback handler like vuEngineRegisterStateHandler().
Functions that cannot be invoked during a callback are highlighted explicitly in the respective API documentation.

\par
Client code also need to ensure that reentrant calls from the callback are synchronized with calls from other
application threads as mentioned earlier in the section on "Multithreading and thread safety".

\par Documentation
Inline documentation is using Doxygen formatting with the C++ convention.

 * \param configSet Set of configurations for creating the Engine instance
 * \param errorCode Optional output error code (can be NULL). The error code will only be set if the call fails,
 * otherwise stays unmodified
 * \returns VU_SUCCESS if the Engine instance was created successfully, otherwise VU_FAILED to indicate an error.
 * The value of \p errorCode provides the specific reason for the error.
 *
 * \details The parameter \p errorCode reports a synchronous error happening during the Engine instance
 * creation process. In order to handle errors that occur asynchronously after the Engine instance has already
 * been created and have a fundamental impact on the Engine lifecycle (e.g. Engine stopped internally due to
 * an invalid license key or run-time camera operation issues), add a VuErrorHandlerConfig configuration to the
 * VuEngineConfigSet used for Engine creation.
 *
 * The error code for synchronously reported errors has the generic type VuErrorCode (as opposed to the
 * more specific VuEngineCreationError type) because Engine creation may fail for multiple reasons incl.
 * configuration errors. Engine creation error codes fall into 2 main categories:
 *    - VuEngineCreationError: General Engine creation error type not related to configuration errors
 *    - Vu*ConfigError: Engine creation errors related to a specific configuration, e.g. VuLicenseConfigError
 *      for license configuration-specific errors of the VuLicenseConfig
 * All error codes related to Engine creation are converted to the generic VuErrorCode type when the error is reported.
 *
 * The error codes for asynchronously reported errors use the type VuEngineError, see details on error conditions
 * and the error handler configuration mechanism in the documentation of the VuErrorHandlerConfig data structure.
 *
 * Each error code has a unique value across the various error types. You can compare the returned error code with
 * the values of the general VuEngineCreationError type as well as the respective error types for the configurations
 * used when creating the Engine instance, e.g. VuLicenseConfigError or VuEngineError to determine the reason for
 * the failure.

 *
 * \par Permissions
 *
 * Your App must fulfill platform-specific permission / configuration requirements in order to successfully create an Engine instance.
 * Your App is responsible for executing the following platform-specific actions prior to invoking vuEngineCreate(), otherwise
 * the Engine creation call may fail or Engine may not work properly:
 *
 * - Android:
 *     - Camera permission: Add the "android.permission.CAMERA" permission to the AndroidManifest.xml and also request it at run-time in
 * your App's code, otherwise Engine fails to initialize with the error VU_ENGINE_CREATION_ERROR_PERMISSION_ERROR.
 *     - Network-related permissions: Add the "android.permission.INTERNET" and "android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" permissions to the
 * AndroidManifest.xml to allow Engine to leverage various cloud services and to ensure an optimal AR experience on all devices by
 * downloading device-specific Engine settings, otherwise Engine fails to initialize with the error
 * VU_ENGINE_CREATION_ERROR_PERMISSION_ERROR.
 *     - High sensor sampling rate: When targeting Android 12 or above, add the "android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS" permission
 * to the AndroidManifest.xml to allow Engine to receive IMU sensor readings at a high rate, otherwise device tracking may not work
 * correctly.
 *
 * - iOS:
 *     - Camera usage description: Add the key "NSCameraUsageDescription" to the Info.plist with an explanation why your App requires camera
 * access, otherwise the App will be rejected by the App Store submission process
 *     - Camera access: Request access to the camera by calling the "AVCaptureDevice requestAccessForMediaType" API with the media type
 * "AVMediaTypeVideo", otherwise Engine fails to initialize with VU_ENGINE_CREATION_ERROR_PERMISSION_ERROR
 *
 * - UWP:
 *     - Video capturing and network device capability: Add the following snippet to the \b \<Capabilities\> tag in your App's
 * Package.appxmanifest to enable camera capturing and full network capabilities, otherwise Engine will not work properly:
 *
 *       \code{.xml}
 *       <Capabilities>
 *           <Capability Name="internetClient" />
 *           <DeviceCapability Name="webcam" />
 *       </Capabilities>
 *       \endcode
 *
 * - Lumin:
 *     - Add the following permissions to your App's manifest.xml, otherwise Engine fails to initialize with the error
 * VU_ENGINE_CREATION_ERROR_PERMISSION_ERROR:
 *         - Camera permissions: Add "CameraCapture" and "ComputerVision" permissions to the manifest.xml
 *         - Network-related permissions: Add the "Internet" permission to the manifest.xml to allow Engine to leverage various cloud
 * services and ensure an optimal AR experience on all devices by downloading device-specific Engine settings
 *         - Perception system permissions: Add "LowLatencyLightwear", "PcfRead" and "WorldReconstruction" permissions to the manifest.xml

 *
 * VuResult vuEngineCreate<ObserverType>Observer(VuEngine* engine, VuObserver** observer,
 *    const Vu<ObserverType>Config* config, Vu<ObserverType>CreationError* errorCode);
 *
 * The configuration data structure can be initialized with default parameters with a dedicated
 * function vu<ObserverType>ConfigDefault(), and can be customized with desired settings.
 * When creation fails, the creation function outputs an observer-specific error code of type
 * Vu<ObserverType>CreationError.
 *
 * The observer-specific configurations have a field of type VuBool called \p activate, which
 * determines whether observer-internal resources should be activated automatically upon
 * creation, or they require explicit activation by calling vuObserverActivate(). All observers
 * are automatically deactivated when stopping the Vuforia Engine via vuEngineStop(), or they
 * can be deactivated individually by calling vuObserverDeactivate().
 *
 * If an observer is configured to be automatically activated on creation and the activation
 * fails, then the \p errorCode parameter supplied to the observer creation function (e.g.
 * vuEngineCreate<ObserverType>Observer()) is set to VU_<OBSERVER_TYPE>_CREATION_ERROR_AUTOACTIVATION_FAILED
 * for all observer types where applicable.
 *
 * Individual observers can be destroyed with the general vuObserverDestroy() function. A list
 * of observers can be destroyed by calling vuObserversDestroy() with a VuObserverList.
 * Neither of the destruction functions are observer-specific, unlike the observer creation functions.
 *
 * Note that for modification of observers (vu<ObserverType>ObserverSet<Property>()) or for
 * creation of observers with non-default optional arguments (for example "scale") it is
 * recommended that all observers from the same database are deactivated as these operations
 * can be expensive otherwise - especially when the database contains a large amount of
 * targets.

// ======== VUFORIA ENGINE STATE MANAGEMENT ========

/** \addtogroup EngineStateUpdateGroup State Management
 * \{
 * The Vuforia State represents a snapshot of what Vuforia Engine "knows" about the user's environment.
 * It contains all information Vuforia clients need to render an AR scene, including observations, camera
 * and rendering information. Individual state information elements can be retrieved from VuState with
 * the respective vuStateGet* getter functions, e.g. vuStateGetObservations() acquires the current list of
 * observations generated by observers. VuState objects are immutable and their data cannot be changed after
 * creation.
 *
 * There are 2 ways to obtain the latest Vuforia State from the Vuforia Engine:
 *
 *   - Pull mechanism: The function vuEngineAcquireLatestState() allows the acquisition of the latest state
 *     on demand while Engine is running. State objects acquired with this mechanism must be released by
 *     calling vuStateRelease() when no longer needed to avoid leaking memory.
 *
 *   - Push mechanism: The vuEngineRegisterStateHandler() allows the registration of a callback function of type
 *     VuStateHandler, which informs the registered client about the latest state as it becomes available. Only
 *     one callback function can be registered at one time. Callbacks keep coming from Engine as long as it is
 *     running or the client unregisters the callback by calling vuEngineRegisterStateHandler() with a nullptr
 *     as the handler function. State objects obtained with this mechanism do not need to (and cannot) be released,
 *     and are valid only during the callback scope.
 *
 * The VuState object acquired via the pull mechanism remains valid as long as the Engine instance is valid or
 * until vuStateRelease() is called to release the internal state data. The VuState object received via the push
 * mechanism remains valid during the scope of the callback.
 *
 * If you wish to extend the lifetime beyond its original scope (e.g. to preserve state data outside the state
 * handler callback), you need to create a state reference. You can create any number of references to a VuState
 * instance by calling vuStateAcquireReference(). A state reference contains the same immutable information as
 * the VuState it has been created from but its lifetime becomes independent from it. This means that even if you
 * call vuStateRelease() on a given VuState, a reference created from it beforehand remains valid until
 * vuStateRelease() is called on the state reference.

     * Vuforia Engine creates a projection matrix from the latest intrinsic camera calibration information
     * available on the current device, which you can retrieve from the Vuforia State via vuStateGetCameraIntrinsics().
     * The projection matrix uses an OpenGL-style column-major matrix with the following right-handed
     * coordinate system convention for the view space:
     *
     * - The X coordinate system axis points to the right and the Y axis points downwards.
     * - The camera is positioned at the coordinate system origin and points in the positive Z direction.
     * - Normalized device coordinates are used where the Z coordinates are normalized to the range (-1, 1).
     *
     * Rendering solutions using a backend with the same matrix convention as OpenGL can use the matrix as is,
     * while those with a different convention (e.g. DirectX) require conversion before use.
     *
     * Vuforia Engine's projection matrix convention is described as follows. Let's assume that the pose matrix
     * retrieved from an observation via vuObservationGetPoseInfo in VuPoseInfo.pose is set to identity, and
     * the near/far clipping planes have been set up accordingly (e.g. from 0.01f to 100.0f) via
     * vuRenderControllerSetProjectionMatrixNearFar().
     *
     * - An object with coordinates (0,0,1) will show up in the middle of the viewport, being one scene unit away
     *   from the camera center.
     * - If we place the object at (0,0,2), it will still be in the middle of the viewport but at half the size as before.
     * - If we move the object to (1,0,1), then it will move to the right of the viewport center.
     * - If we move the object to (0,1,1), then it will move to lower than the viewport center.
     *
     * Since the Vuforia Engine API provides access to the intrinsic camera calibration, you can always build your
     * own projection matrix if your application uses a rendering solution that requires a different convention.
     * In this case, the observations' pose matrix must be also converted accordingly.
